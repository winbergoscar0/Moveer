A bot that moves users from one voice channel to another. Including locked and hidden voice channels!

## We currently got 4 commands that all move users in different ways.


### **!cmove:** ↓ 
Moves users spread across multiple voice channels to one without the need of joining a voice channel. <br>(Command must be sent inside "moveeradmin")
<br>Example command: `!cmove channel#1 @user1 @user2`.

### **!move:** ↓

Moves @mentions of users inside the Moveer voice channel to you. User1 is required to be inside the “Moveer” voice channel.
<br>Example command `!move @user1 @user2`


### **!gmove:** ↓
Moves users inside  GmoveerX to you with one command. If the voice channel is named gmoveerPubg the command becomes
<br>Example command `!gmove pubg`
 

### **!fmove:** ↓ 
Moves users inside one voicechannel to another. Moves users inside overwatch to pubg. <br>(Command must be sent inside "moveeradmin")
<br>Example command `!fmove overwatch pubg`


# Notes:
1. If your voice channel contains spaces use `!fmove "channel 1" "channel 2"`
2. `!fmove` and `!cmove` are both admin commands and requires the command to be sent inside a text channel named "moveeradmin"
3. `!move` and `!gmove` both have admin versions that removes the requirements of users being inside "Moveer" or "GmoveerOverwatch". If sent inside "moveeradmin" both commands can move people from any channel. Please note that the !gmove will require the full name of the voicechannel.
