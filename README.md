A bot that moves users from one voice channel to another. Including locked and hidden voice channels!

## We currently have 6 commands that all move users in different ways.

### **cmove:** ↓

Moves users spread across multiple voice channels to one without the need of joining a voice channel.
<br>Example command: `/cmove channel#1 @user1 @user2`.

### **fmove:** (Perfect for Amoung Us gameplay) ↓

Moves users inside one voice channel to another. Moves users inside gameplay to mute.
<br>Example command `/fmove gameplay mute`

### **rmove:** ↓

Moves users with a certain role to you. For example `/rmove dps` moves all members with "dps" role to you.
<br>Example command `/rmove "super admins"`

### **tmove:** ↓

Moves users with a certain role to specific channel. For example `/tmove channel1 dps` moves all members with "dps" role to channel1.
<br>Example command `/tmove channel1 "super admins"`

### **ymove:** ↓ (Perfect for breakout rooms and Blood on the Clocktower)

Spreads user across voice channels. For example `/ymove "before games" "games" 5` moves all user from "before games" and spread them, randomlywith 5 users in each voice, across channels in the category "games"
<br>Example command `/ymove "before games" "games" 5`

### **zmove:** ↓

Best used to move everyone back to a single channel after `ymove` is used. For example `/zmove "games" "after games"` will move all users inside the "games" category to the "after games" voice channel.
<br>Example command `/zmove "games" "after games"`
