A bot that moves users from one voice channel to another. Including locked and hidden voice channels!

## We currently got 7 commands that all move users in different ways.


### **!cmove:** ↓ 
Moves users spread across multiple voice channels to one without the need of joining a voice channel. <br>(Command must be sent inside a text channel named "moveeradmin")
<br>Example command: `!cmove channel#1 @user1 @user2`.

### **!move:** ↓

Moves @mentions of users inside the Moveer voice channel to you. User1 is required to be inside the “Moveer” voice channel.
<br>Example command `!move @user1 @user2`


### **!gmove:** ↓
Moves users inside  GmoveerX to you with one command. If the voice channel is named gmoveerPubg use the example command
<br>Example command `!gmove pubg`
 

### **!fmove:** ↓ 
Moves users inside one voicechannel to another. Moves users inside overwatch to pubg. <br>(Command must be sent inside a text channel named "moveeradmin")
<br>Example command `!fmove overwatch pubg`

### **!rmove:** ↓ 
Moves users with a certain role to you. For example `!rmove dps` moves all members with "dps" role to you.
<br>Example command `!rmove "super admins"`

### **!tmove:** ↓ 
Moves users with a certain role to specific channel. For example `!tmove channel1 dps` moves all members with "dps" role to channel1.
<br>Example command `!tmove channel1 "super admins"`

### **!ymove:** ↓ 
Spreads user across voice channels.  For example `!ymove "before games" "games" 5` moves all user from "before games" and spread them, randomlywith 5 users in each voice, across channels in the category "games"
<br>Example command `!ymove "before games" "games" 5`

# Important notes:
1. If your names contains spaces use " around it. example: `!fmove "channel 1" "channel 2"`
2. `!fmove`, `!cmove` and `!rmove` are all admin commands and requires the command to be sent inside a text channel named "moveeradmin" (or add a secondary channel, see note 5)
3. `!gmove` and `!move` commands sent inside "moveeradmin" moves people from any channel and removes the requirement to be inside "Moveer" or "Gmoveer". Please note that the !gmove will require the full name of the voicechannel.
4. If you want to block users from getting moved from a specific channel, example your AFK channel while using `!tmove` or `!rmove`. Contact the moderators in the discord below!
5. If you want to add a secondary moveeradmin channel (with your own name) use the command `!changema` by writing `!changema #<ChannelName>`. Be sure the #tag the textchannel. You can now have 1 channel of your choice that allows admin commands!
